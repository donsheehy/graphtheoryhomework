  \section{Hamiltonian Paths}
  Recall that an Eulerian path in $G$ is (the image of) a homomorphism $f:P_m\to G$ such that $f_E$ is bijective.
  Similarly, a Hamiltonian path in $G$ is (the image of) a homomorphism $f:P_m\to G$ such that $f_V$ is bijective.
  Let $G$ be a graph with a vertex $u$ such that $G\setminus u$ has three connected components.
  \textbf{Prove that $G$ does not have a Hamiltonian path.}
