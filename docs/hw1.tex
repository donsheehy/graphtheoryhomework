  \section{$k$-connectivity}
    Let $G$ be a $4$-connected graph and let $v_1,\ldots, v_4$ be four vertices of $G$.
    Let $H_0$ be formed from $G$ by adding a new vertex $u$ and four edges $(u,v_1), \ldots , (u,v_4)$.
    \textbf{1.1. Prove that $H_0$ is $4$-connected.}

    Let $H_1$ be formed from $G$ by adding a new vertex $u$ and the $|V_G|$ edges $\{(u,v) \mid v\in V_G\}$.
    \textbf{1.2. Prove that $H_1$ is $5$-connected.}


  \section{Hamiltonian Paths}
  Recall that an Eulerian path in $G$ is (the image of) a homomorphism $f:P_m\to G$ such that $f_E$ is bijective.
  Similarly, a Hamiltonian path in $G$ is (the image of) a homomorphism $f:P_m\to G$ such that $f_V$ is bijective.
  Let $G$ be a graph with a vertex $u$ such that $G\setminus u$ has three connected components.
  \textbf{Prove that $G$ does not have a Hamiltonian path.}

  \section{Graph Coloring}
    Let $f:G\to H$ be a graph homomorphism.
    \textbf{Prove that $G$ is $|V_H|$-colorable.}
